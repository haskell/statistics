# Statistics: efficient, general purpose statistics

This package provides the Statistics module, a Haskell library for
working with statistical data in a space- and time-efficient way.

Where possible, we give citations and computational complexity
estimates for the algorithms used.


# Performance

This library has been carefully optimised for high performance.  To
obtain the best runtime efficiency, it is imperative to compile
libraries and applications that use this library using a high level of
optimisation.
